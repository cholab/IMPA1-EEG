# IMPA1-EEG
This repository contains the Matlab code used for Walker et al., (Under Review). Loss-of-function mutation in inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) results in abnormal synchrony in resting-state EEG.


This project was used to preprocess and analyze resting state data under eyes open and eyes closed conditions. This code may not be fully generalizable, and we may have made assumptions related to our data/equipment that may not apply to your own. Furthermore, the inline commenting is a work-in-progress. We have attempted to make sure the upper level functions are well documented and we are continuing to refine the language to make sure the functions are interpretable. The 'util' functions are constantly under development as we refine our methods. We will post updates as necessary. Please contact cpwalker@bcm.edu if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this code.
